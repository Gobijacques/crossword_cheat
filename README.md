CURRENT LANGUAGE: FRENCH (can be changed by finding a .txt word list of other languages and changing the file name at the beginning of the code).
My take on making a simple python3 function that you can use to cheat at games such as crossword and hangman.
Usage: search(clue)
Your clue should looke like this: c$a$$ ('$' represents unknown letters and other letters are the ones you know)
Example: 
>>> search('$ictionn$$$$')
1 results. Proceed? (y)
